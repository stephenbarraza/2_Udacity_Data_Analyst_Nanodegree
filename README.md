# Udacity-DANd
### Links to all my project submittals and reviews for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

#### Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends

In this project, the analyst will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where they live to overall global temperature trends.

#### Project 2 - Investigate a Data Set

In this project, the analyst will choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. They will go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing their findings.

#### Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

In this project, the analyste will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  They will use the necessary statistical tools required to perform and interpret the A/B test.

#### Project 4 - Wrangle and Analyze Data

In this project, the analyst will gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling using the Twitter platform as it's data source.

#### Project 5 - Communicate Data Findings

In the first part of this project, the analyst will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, the analyst will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that they discovered in their selected dataset.
